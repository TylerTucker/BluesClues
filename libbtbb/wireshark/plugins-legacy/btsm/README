BTSM Wireshark plugin
=====================

This is the Bluetooth Low Energy Security Manager plugin for Wireshark.

To build this on Debian/Ubuntu/BackTrack linux distributions:
  sudo apt-get install wireshark-dev wireshark
  cd libbtbb/wireshark/plugins/btsm/
  cmake .
  make
  make install

This will install to the .wireshark/ in your home directory. To override
this set the DESTDIR environment variable when running cmake.
