Bluetooth ATT Protocol Dissector
================================

This is a plugin-ized version of the Bluetooth ATT protocol dissector
from the Wireshark trunk. I made the very minimal changes necessary to
get it to build as a plugin: defining a couple constants and changing an
include path.

This plugin is unneccessary if you are using Wireshark trunk. Only use
it if you are using a distro packaged Wireshark that does not have btatt
protocol support.
