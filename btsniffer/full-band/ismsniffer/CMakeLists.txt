### Set up build environment ##################################################
# Choose a static or shared-library build (shared is default, and static will
# probably need some special care!)
# Set this to ON in order to link a static build of UHD:
option(UHD_USE_STATIC_LIBS OFF)

# This example also requires Boost:
set(BOOST_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS
    program_options
    system
    thread
)

    else(BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK)

# To add UHD as a dependency to this project, add a line such as this:

### Configure Compiler ########################################################
