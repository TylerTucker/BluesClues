NOTES:

1. Compatibility:

    Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 "xenial" 64-bit.

2. Requirements:

    Before compiling please install libuhd-dev:

        $ apt-get install libuhd-dev

    and refresh the FPGA images if required:

        $ uhd_images_downloader

3. Compile guide:

    Create a build folder and compile:
    (IMPORTANT! UHD version 3.9.7 is REQUIRED)

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make

4. Usage guide:

    Please run "ismsniffermt --help" to have a list
    of all options.

    To capture with a single host, two B210 boards are needed.
    First determine board serial numbers with:

        $ uhd_find_devices

    Then run with:

        $ ./ismsniffermt \
            --runlo --lorxgain 70 --loargs "serial=3094D6E" \
            --runhi --hirxgain 70 --hiargs "serial=30875C0" \
            --txgain 70

    This will end up with two files

        usrp_samples_lo.dat
        usrp_samples_hi.dat

5. Spectral properties of the captured files:

    The loband file is 44MHz extending in range [2398-2442]MHz.
    The hiband file is 44MHz extending in range [2438-2482]MHz.

    During capture the loband board can transmit periodically a BLE
    advertisement packet in BLE channel 19 (2444 MHz).
    By extracting and timestamping this packet sequence from both
    bands it is possible to have a tightly synchornised capture.

6. Single device usage:

    On the loband host run:

        $ ./ismsniffermt --runlo --lorxgain 70 --txgain 70

    On the hiband host run:

        $ ./ismsniffermt --runhi --hirxgain 70
